\noindent {\it And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world -- he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God... But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short...}

%Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.\\
%Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.\\
%\vin And now upon his western wing he leaned,\\
%\vin Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careened,\\
%Now the black planet shadowed arctic snows.\\
%Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars\\
%\vin With memory of the old revolt from Awe,\\
%He reached a middle height, and at the stars,\\
%\vin \vin Which are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.\nobreak\\
%\vin \vin Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,\\*
%\vin The army of unalterable law.
