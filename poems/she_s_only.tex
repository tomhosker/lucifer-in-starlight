\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
She's only \sfrac{$9$}{$10$} beautiful,\marginnote{\footnotesize Blind Girl\\ on a Train\\ $ $\\ \sfrac{$9$}{$10$} = ``nine\\ tenths'' not\\ ``nine out of\\ ten''}\\*
\vin And yet we men are standing reverently around,\\
\vin \vin Watching her listening\\*
\vin To her tapes, and sometimes smile, belle of Coach F.\\!

Her hair is tangled \& black, like black-bryony,\\*
\vin Ringletting down to her seat, beneath which\\
\vin \vin A violin case\\*
\vin Edged with red velvet is tucked between her calves.\\!

And those cheeks, as tender as meltwater\\*
\vin And as clear, that small voice purling\\
\vin \vin More rosily than mulled wine,\\*
\vin That six hand\marginnote{\footnotesize hand = 4 in} waist no soul has yet handled.\\!

But the light fails, lovers meet and journeys end.\marginnote{\footnotesize Shak}\\*
\vin She alights, to be met by her first sweetheart,\\
\vin \vin Whose head she kisses\\*
\vin As if the world, and not her, had gone blind:\\!

And nothing matters more than a girl,\\*
\vin Of a velvety, late autumn early evening,\\
\vin \vin With her fingers\\*
\vin In the lapels of her lover's jacket.
