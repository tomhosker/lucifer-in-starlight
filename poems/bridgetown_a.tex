\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
{\sc Bridgetown}, a night in a gale with a girl,\marginnote{\footnotesize ES}\\*
The doctor I met on board, talking over\\
Old lost lovers and {\hoskeroe The Last Picture Show}\marginnote{\footnotesize Ginsberg\\ ``Dream\\ Record''}\\
With cold beef \& chocolates \& a rough scotch.\\
Darkness. I lay in her bunk\\
And travelled in dreams back to a garden in {\sc Rome}\\
Where as a younger man I'd man spent one summer.\\
You \& \emph{Alex} were behind the bar. It was freezing,\marginnote{\footnotesize RR}\\*
And the snow fell through the rich blackness into\\ \vin \vin our drinks.\\!

Ah there you were, \emph{Islay}, with those curious clear\\ \vin \vin blue eyes\\*
And tangled soft brown hair like a river of living bronze.\\
The time between us is nothing at all,\\*
Nor death and the river of forgetfulness.
\end{verse}
