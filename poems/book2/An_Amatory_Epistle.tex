\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
That you're still, in a sense, a virgin,\\*
Drink like \textit{George Best} and talk like \textit{Charles Spurgeon}\\
Is all the cause for love a soul\\
Like mine can bear and still stay whole.\\
These raise the question (who can drop it?),\poeticmarginnote{Auden, ``T the Great''}\\
If God exists, why can't he stop it? --\\
The young \& winsome aged, or killed by traffic;\\*
A girl like you in love with all things sapphic.\\!

Alas, I'm more like \textit{Mars} than \textit{Venus},\\*
But does that have to come between us?\\
I'm told I'm gifted with my fingers,\\
And, though I've not tried cunnalingus,\\
You're welcome to compare my lips\\
To any temptress' tastebud-tips,\\
And summon cries of joy, not laughter.\\*
I'd even like to cuddle after.\\!

Although I cannot make my chest hair\\*
Flee and put a plump round breast there,\\
Nor bid my beard \& size-nine shoes farewell,\\
The same goes for my love as well.\\
Heart of oak has not yet made rejection\\
Cause for loss of ardour or dejection.\\
Time will only say, I told you so;\poeticmarginnote{\textit{Ibid}, ``If I Could Tell You''}\\
And yet it suits me more than you know\\*
To play \textit{Tiresias} to your virago.
