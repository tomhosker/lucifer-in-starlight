\par My feet have found their furrow, my mouth its bridle:
\par The lover has found his beloved, and \textit{Jack} has his \textit{Jill}.
\par A cup of wine was offered me, for your vines were heavy with the riches thereof:
\par For whoever joins himself to a living soul shall inherit life itself:
\par And whoever welcomes immortality into his own heart shall himself become immortal:
\par And though the whole world should perish, I cannot die:
\par I shall live by the wine of the water of life forever.
